# About me

![](murali.jpg)

I'm a Ph.D student at Georgia Tech advised by Prof. [Faramarz Fekri](http://fekri.ece.gatech.edu/). Prior to this I received my Master's degree from Georgia Tech in 2020 and undergraduate degree from National Institute of Technology, Trichy in 2018. My current research focus is on learning causal relations from observational data in particular when the data is taken from compressed measuring systems.

In my spare time I enjoy cooking good food, listening to music, playing my guitar and reading a book every once in a while.
